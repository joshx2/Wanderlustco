        <h2>Attractions</h2>
        <p>Cancun offers a plethora of attractions like the Mayan ruins. The Mayan cities, full of magnificent stone temples and pyramids, were primarily ceremonial centers. Most of the Maya lived in rural areas and were farmers who looked to the priests of the cities for direction on the best days to plant, harvest, and marry. The Maya are famed for their impressive knowledge of mathematics and astronomy, which were integral to their religious rituals. They are also known for the practice of human sacrifice, which was a means of appeasing and nourishing the gods. </p>

        <h2>Local Cuisine</h2>
        <p>“What food is Cancun famous for?” is one of the questions we receive most often from guests on our Cancun food tours. The cuisine of Mexico is regarded as an “Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity” by UNESCO, each region of the country offering up its own unique dishes and flavors.
So, what does a young city like Cancun bring to the table? A lot of influence from pre-hispanic Mayan dishes, the offerings of the sea and the cuisine from the neighboring state of Yucatan. Cancun was built by people from all over Mexico and you can find this reflected in the wide range of incredible dishes you’ll discover.</p>
